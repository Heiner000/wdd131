# Workout Planner

## To-Do List:

-   [] 1. Implement the generateWorkoutPlan() function:

    -   Create an algorithm for workout plan generation based on user inputs.
    -   Consider progressive overload principles in the plan creation.
    -   Ensure the function returns a Promise that resolves with the generated plan.

-   [] 2. Enhance the displayWorkoutPlan(plan) function:

    -   Create a structured layout for the workout plan (e.g., using tables or lists).
    -   Include exercise details, sets, reps, and rest periods.
    -   Add progression strategy for each exercise.

-   [] 3. Implement the savePlan() function:

    -   Use localStorage to save the generated workout plan.
    -   Consider saving user preferences as well for future use.

-   [] 4. Add form validation:

    -   Ensure required fields are filled.
    -   Validate input ranges (e.g., workout duration).

-   [] 5. Implement error handling:

    -   Add user-friendly error messages for form validation and plan generation issues.

-   [] 6. Create a function to load saved plans:

    -   Retrieve plans from localStorage.
    -   Allow users to view and select previously saved plans.

-   [] 7. Implement the progressive overload algorithm:

    -   Define how to increase difficulty over time for each exercise.
    -   Integrate this into the plan generation and display functions.

-   [] 8. Add responsiveness to the generated plan:

    -   Ensure the plan display adjusts well for different screen sizes.

-   [] 9. Implement accessibility features:

    -   Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.
    -   Add appropriate ARIA labels and roles.

-   [] 10. Optimize performance:
    -   Consider lazy loading for exercise data if the JSON file is large.
    -   Implement debouncing for form inputs if necessary.
